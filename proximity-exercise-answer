2. Both divs changed in width from 350px to approximately 315px.

3. When both divs are floated right, they move to the far right of the ruler and window.
div 2 is oriented to the left, and div 1 is oriented to the right.

4. When both divs are floated left they move to the far left of the ruler and window. div 1 is oriented to the left,
and div 2 is oriented to the right.

5. When the browser window is set to a size less than 600px across, div 2 is cut into by an approximate 50px amount.
This obstructs the full view of the div 2 box, and covers up text within the div.

6. When testDiv1 is floated right and testDiv2 is floated left, testDiv1 is oriented to the far left of the ruler and
window, while testDiv2 is floated to the far left of the ruler and window.

7. When testDiv1's width is set to 2000 px, the columns are no longer in the same plane. testDiv1 is horribly
elongated, to the point where half of the testDiv1 is off the left side of the screen (unreadable,) and testDiv2 is
thrown down below.

9. When the browser window is resized after setting width percentages, the testDivs resize proportionally to their
container size (the browser window).
